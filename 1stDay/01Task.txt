Task1 : What is Web development ?

As per Wikipedia,web development is the work  involved in developing a website for the internet(World Wide Web) or an intranet(a private network)

Internet is basically what we enter in the browser using www 

Intranet is the private network which is not accessible on www
and its access is only limited to a certain individual
Eg:Lets say a big company might have its private network for its employees

When we create a website on the internet or on the intranet which can be visited by the people using a tool like browser.
The entire process building such a website is called web development
