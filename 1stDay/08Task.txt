Task 7 : Commenting in HTML.

If revist the code after few months and understand why the below code was written here
We wont be able to remember , we will just guessed why we used it

And if ourr code is going to be complex with n number lines of code
so it becomes difficult to track so wht does a piece of code needs

or if a third person is going to visit the code , he wont understand 
so in all these case wew use comments

<!-- --> comments- to demonstarte what that piece of code is meant for
that whatever we have commented wont be visible on the browser.
