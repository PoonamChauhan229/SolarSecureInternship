Task 3 : Client server model:

In the Client-server-model there are certain things which happens on the Server side and certain things that take place on the client side 

For the certain things that happen to the server side, we write server side code 
and for the certain things that happen to the client side, we write client side code

Server-side scripting is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produce a response customized for each users(clients) request to the website.

Eg:facebook
if we go facebook , different pages will display different contents
this means server of facebook has customized the page based on the user which is accessing it.

Client-Side Code: program that runs on the client machine(browser) and deals with the user interface/display and any other processing that can happen on client machine like reading/writing cookies

In case of facebook, sever is creating customized web pages for different users and sending it to the client
whereas client takes the code and builds web page out of it.

The code which goes to the client and on the basis of which client makes the display of the code is called client side code
