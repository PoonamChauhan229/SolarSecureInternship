NodeJs is an runtime environment which is used to run JS on the serverside.
Node.Js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
Before 2009, JavaScript was used only for frontend i.e. only used for interaction purpose.

Then Node came into Market and then we can use JavaScript for forntend as well as for backend.

So, you can build fullstack application only with 1 language i.e. universal language which is JavaScript.
So its the 10th project as the Node Js connection.

We should know, what is the advantage of Node JS server, 
How can we connect our NodeJs Server.
How can we perform operations.

We have done projects in JS Meals,etc where we got the data from the external APIS which we have not created.
Someone has created that API and we have used that API directly 
So now , with the help of NodeJs going to create our own API.
because NodeJs is the runtime environment for running backend with the help of JS.

So Downlaod external software node js, if we dont do so we cant build an server .

Open the below link:
